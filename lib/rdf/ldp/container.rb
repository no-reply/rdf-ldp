module RDF::LDP
  ##
  # An LDP Basic Container. This also serves as a base class for other
  # container types. Containers are implemented as `RDF::LDP::RDFSources` with
  # the ability to contain other resources.
  #
  # Containers respond to `#post`, allowing new resources to be added to them.
  # On the public interface (not running through HTTP/`#request`), this is
  # supported by `#add` and `#remove`.
  #
  # Containers will throw errors when attempting to edit them in conflict with
  # LDP's restrictions on changing containment triples.
