  class NonRDFSource < Resource
    ##
    # StorageAdapters bundle the logic for mapping a `NonRDFSource` to a
    # specific IO stream. Implementations must conform to a minimal interface:
    #
    #  - `#initailize` must accept a `resource` parameter. The input should be
    #     a `NonRDFSource` (LDP-NR).
    #  - `#io` must yield and return a IO object in binary mode that represents
    #    the current state of the LDP-NR.
    #    - If a block is passed to `#io`, the implementation MUST allow return a
    #      writable IO object and that anything written to the stream while
    #      yielding is synced with the source in a thread-safe manner.
    #    - Clients not passing a block to `#io` SHOULD call `#close` on the
    #      object after reading it.
    #    - If the `#io` object responds to `#to_path` it MUST give the location
    #      of a file whose contents are identical the IO object's. This supports
    #      Rack's response body interface.
    #  - `#delete` remove the contents from the corresponding storage. This MAY
    #      be a no-op if is undesirable or impossible to delete the contents
    #      from the storage medium.
    #
    # @see http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/master/file/SPEC#The_Body
    #   for details about `#to_path` in Rack response bodies.
    #
    # @example reading from a `StorageAdapter`
    #   storage = StorageAdapter.new(an_nr_source)
    #   storage.io.read # => [string contents of `an_nr_source`]
    #
    # @example writing to a `StorageAdapter`
    #   storage = StorageAdapter.new(an_nr_source)
    #   storage.io { |io| io.write('moomin') }
    #
    # Beyond this interface, implementations are permitted to behave as desired.
    # They may, for instance, reject undesirable content or alter the graph (or
    # metagraph) of the resource. They should throw appropriate `RDF::LDP`
    # errors when failing to allow the middleware to handle response codes and
    # messages.
    #
    # The base storage adapter class provides a simple File storage
    # implementation.

    # @todo check thread saftey on write for base implementation
