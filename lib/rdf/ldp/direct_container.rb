module RDF::LDP
  ##
  # An extension of `RDF::LDP::Container` implementing direct containment.
  # This adds the concepts of a membership resource, predicate, and triples to
  # the Basic Container's containment triples.
  #
  # When the membership resource is an `RDFSource`, the membership triple is
  # added/removed from its graph when the resource created/deleted within the
  # container. When the membership resource is a `NonRDFSource`, the triple is
  # added/removed on its description's graph instead.
  #
  # A membership constant URI and membership predicate MUST be specified as
  # described in LDP--exactly one of each. If none is given, we default to
  # the container itself as a membership resource and `ldp:member` as predicate.
  # If more than one of either is given, all `#add/#remove` (POST/DELETE)
  # requests will fail.

    #   transaction. It is possible for the second transaction to fail, causing
    #   the resource to persist in an invalid state. It is also possible for a
    #   read to occur between the two transactions.
    # @todo Make atomic. Consider just raising an error instead of adding
    #   triples. There's a need to handle this issue for repositories with
    #   snapshot reads, as well as those without.
